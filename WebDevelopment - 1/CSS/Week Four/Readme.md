### What is CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

### The relationship between HTML & CSS

HTML is the structure of the page. CSS is the design of the page. HTML is the content of the page. CSS is the presentation of the page. HTML is the skeleton of the page. CSS is the skin of the page.

### The role of CSS in web design

CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

### The syntax of CSS rules

A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

    ```css
    selector {
    property: value;
    }
    ```

### CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

#### Element Selectors

Element selectors select elements based on the element name.

    ```css
    p {
    color: red;
    }
    ```

#### Class Selectors

Class selectors select elements with a specific class attribute.

    ```css
    .center {
    text-align: center;
    }
    ```

#### ID Selectors

ID selectors select elements with a specific id attribute.

    ```css
    #intro {
    color: blue;
    }
    ```
